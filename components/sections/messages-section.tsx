I've seen your channel grow from all the hard work you've put in and I'm so happy to have witnessed you go through your ups and downs, steadily growing both as a streamer and a person. Girl you used to be so shy to do anything new and now look at you! You've even done a face reveal! Congratulations on everything Soap. Not just the anniversary but the whole process that you went through to get where you are right now. While I do sometimes miss the long conversations we'd have in your chat since I'd be the only one there, I love that you now have a community that's always there for you, appreciates you, and supports you wholeheartedly. Alright now all that's outta the way pls gimme my Ubel cosplay with matching armpit poses. Thanks",

      "Happy Streaming Anniversary!! 🎉 3 years!? Sheeeesh! I may not have been there for your entire journey, but from what Ive seen, its clear youve been doing incredibly well and growing so much in your career. I'm usually just lurking and listening in the background during your streams Im too shy to type, sorry 😭, but your stream is honestly one of the few places where I feel comfortable enough to even send a message in chat. Your streams are so chill, and I enjoy being there even though I dont even play the games you stream xdd Wishing you continued success in everything youre pursuing, your streaming, your singing career, and as a teacher (give me free mentoring when you succeed I CANT SIGHT READ! 😆). You truly deserve it, and Im excited to see how far youll go from here! ps. dont forget us when you get famous hehe!",

I first watched your stream a year ago and quickly started interacting with this community, making my first really good online friends, Ephy and Mario el Chavo. Since then I have had the honour to properly get to know you and this community and I am proud to call you all my friends. Nowadays I go by many names. Mr. Poo, Big P, Chefpoo, Sexypoo(real). These are all names invented (and ruined) by the precious friends that I have made here. You, The Dax, have created something truly special that I will forever treasure. My time spent here has had me feeling happier than ever and I will be forever grateful to you. These feelings will probably never change, even if you become bald.  \nThank you for still doing this after three whole years because your persistence is what birthed the Soapdaxverse. \nMuch love and many thanks, \nBig P",

I mostly lurk, but the streams I hear from my side screen always sound fun and amusing, they make me smile. The kindness you demonstrate by turning on translations, despite it only being me speaking Japanese, is amazingly radiant. The way you are surrounded by such creative and kind people are proof that your are a good person, and your outgoing bright demeanor are something that i appreciate and really like about you. I'm jealous of the people who get to meet someone like you in real life. If you would allow, I would like to share some wise words of someone I know: The beauty of gems that aren't diamonds, are the fact that they don't try to be diamonds. Everyone has their own path, and hope you will never lose sight of yours. Congratulations Affiliate!",

            This is were the idea for this website was born, to be honest its
            heavily inspired by what Emmisu's community did for her birthday,
            and i though it would be a pretty cool idea to do the same and let
            the community comunicate their thoughts to you on this big milestone
            you accomplished.
